Use Google Cloud Vertex AI Embeddings or PaLM to convert user queries into vectors.
Use MongoDB Atlas Vector Search to find the closest-matching communities.
Example queries:
  “Tech groups for Black women in the UK”
  “Support circles for moms going back to work”
  “Communities for women founders in fintech”

// Example MongoDB Atlas Vector Search query
AI-Powered Recommendations
Use NLP to tag, rank, and group communities based on similarity and relevance.
Bonus: Build a lightweight RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) system that summarizes communities per user need.


Frontend: React / Next.js / TailwindCSS
Backend: Node.js / Python / Express
Database: MongoDB Atlas + Vector Search
AI/NLP: Google Cloud Vertex AI / PaLM / LangChain
Search: MongoDB Vector Index (with text embeddings)
Deployment: Google Cloud Run / Firebase Hosting
Data Sourcing: Scrapy, RSS feeds, APIs from Eventbrite etc.


👩🏽‍💻 How You’ll Use It in MataConnect
Find or extract public data about women-centric communities, events, or organizations.
E.g., Scrape Meetup, use Eventbrite API, or find CSVs on Kaggle or UN data.
Ingest that dataset into MongoDB Atlas
Generate embeddings of key content (descriptions, themes, etc.)
Index with MongoDB vector search
Build a user interface to query it semantically and explore insights


📌 For Your Hackathon (MataConnect)
To qualify:
You could scrape or query publicly available women’s events (from Eventbrite, etc.)
You could use an open Kaggle CSV about women in business or tech
Or find a dataset of NGOs or support groups for women (e.g., from UN Women)


1) Load Data into MongoDB ATLAS -[DONE]
2) Use full-text search to enable keyword lookups 
3) Use vector search to enable semantic, meaning-based matching
4)Use Google Cloud’s Vertex AI Embedding API to:
    Convert community descriptions into vector embeddings
    Analyze descriptions for topics, focus areas, or categories (e.g., AI, wellness, finance)
5) AI for Generation:
    Let users type natural-language queries like:
      “I’m a Black woman founder in the UK looking for mentorship and funding support.”
6) Google Cloud Integration:
    Use Google Cloud Run to deploy your backend
    Use Vertex AI APIs for embeddings and summarization
    Store and query your data from MongoDB Atlas, hosted in the cloud
    Optional: use BigQuery if you want to analyze trends (e.g., “Where are women’s groups lacking globally?”)

Build an AI-powered discovery tool to help women find the right communities from a public dataset using MongoDB + Google Cloud + Vector Search.
